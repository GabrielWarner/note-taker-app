# Note Taker App - Gabriel Warner

## Description
In this application I created various express server routes to post, get and delete. I imported uuid and a helpers js files to help me read and write to the db with ease. I used the uuid helper to randomly select an id for every note that is saved into the database. I managed to get the delete function working by creating a route for it. When looking at the other helper functions in the utils file I saw that the read and append file was similar to what I needed so i copy and pasted it and created a new helper function called readDeleteAppend.
